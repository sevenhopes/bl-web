		<div class="bl-wrap">
			<p class="bl-p">Since Bridge Light’s programs include repeated reviews, missing one or two classes doesn’t have a significant impact on students’ learning. However, when the homeroom teacher determines that a student needs help with learning due to long absence, a 1 on 1 class called a Building Session will be provided. The homeroom teachers try their best to get all the students to the next level together. <i class="bl-gray">(Please note that we don’t offer the class for the exact number of days as a student missed.)</i></p>
